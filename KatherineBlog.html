				<p>Ok, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right, um HI! My name is, well, you know what I'll make up a new name. My name will be Tim. Tim Tim Tim, it's such a bland name but it will do for now.</p>
				<p>I went online to find a photo that closely resembles my home, it's not perfect but you'll get the gist if it. This "internet" thing is still pretty new for me but I think I got the hang of this. Anyways, here's to a new way of receiving knowledge</p>

				<p>I found a new pet! Obviously this isn't my actual pet but It's close enough to what I have. I named it Ches and I hope no one else in my family finds out about Ches. Someone might...hurt him. Not to worry, Ches will be safe with me.</p>

				<p>To whoever is reading this, I might be offline for a bit. I suffered an acciedent, more specifically I fell down the stairs due to fooling around.</p>
				<p>
				
					You know what...screw it, I made this blog to be honest and be myself so here's what actually happened. 

				</p>
				<p>
					I've had a brother in which, for as long as I could remember wasn't the best guy ever. He was the one who pushed me down the stairs. I can't really say anything about it or else he'll make my life more difficult than it already is. Well... thanks for listening to my little rant and I hope you have a good day.

				<p>THIS WAS A MISTAKE. He found out about my blog and he might get access to it. I'll do what I can to stop him but if this is my last post, I just want to say a proper good bye and thanks for listening to me.</p>

				<p>Hello there. So this is what Oliver has been doing. Telling his story to strangers online. He's so sad isn't he. </p>
				<p>
				
					Well, that's going to have to change.

				</p>
				<p>
					You'll never hear from him again ;)
